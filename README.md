Hi! I'm a college student majoring in business management but I hate my major so now I'm trying to learn some programming hehe. I'm also part of my school aeromodelling research lab! Looking forward to learn a lot of things to expand my horizon~

My discord is @rosiemintz feel free to hit me up over there, always interested to join fun and challenging projects! I'm learning web development for a school project right now and also aiming to learn C++ and/or Python in the near future.
